/*
APPLICABILITY

- To add responsibilities to individual objects dynamically and transparently, that is, without affecting other objects
- For responsibilities that can be withdrawn
- When extension by subclassing is impractical.
Sometimes a large number of independent extensions are possible and would produce an explosion of subclasses to support every combination.
Or a class definition may be hidden or otherwise unavailable for subclassing
